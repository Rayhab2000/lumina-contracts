//! Lumina Registry — on-chain contract registry for the Lumina indexer.
//!
//! Projects deploy their Soroban contracts and register them here so that
//! the Lumina indexer can discover and prioritize indexing their events.
//! This creates a permissionless, decentralized index manifest for Stellar.
//!
//! Flow:
//!   1. Project deploys a Soroban contract
//!   2. Project calls register_contract() on the Lumina Registry
//!   3. Lumina indexer polls the Registry for new entries and begins indexing
//!   4. Indexed events become queryable via the Lumina GraphQL API
//!
//! ## Governance model (multi-sig admin)
//!
//! Privileged actions — deactivating another owner's contract, upgrading the
//! wasm, changing the admin set — go through a **propose → approve →
//! execute** flow rather than a single signer:
//!
//! 1. Any admin calls `propose_*`; a `Proposal` is stored and a
//!    `proposal_proposed` event is emitted.
//! 2. Other admins call `approve_proposal`; each unique approval is counted
//!    and a `proposal_approved` event emitted.  When the threshold is reached
//!    the proposal becomes *ready* and a `proposal_ready` event is emitted —
//!    but it is **not** executed yet.
//! 3. After `TIMELOCK_LEDGERS` ledgers have elapsed since the proposal became
//!    ready, anyone may call `execute_proposal`; a `proposal_executed` event
//!    is emitted.
//! 4. Proposals that are never executed do not expire automatically; they can
//!    be superseded by a new proposal for the same action or simply ignored.
//!
//! ## Resource cost benchmarks
//!
//! Soroban meters execution: an entrypoint that grows past a resource limit
//! simply stops working on-chain while passing every test in the local host.
//! The scanning views (`get_active_contracts`, `get_contracts_by_category`,
//! `get_contracts_by_tag`) are the obvious candidates because their cost grows
//! with the size of the registry index.
//!
//! `registry/tests/bench.rs` uses the test host's budget instrumentation to
//! record CPU instructions and memory per entrypoint and asserts a ceiling for
//! the scanning views. The numbers below are the ceilings asserted in CI; a
//! significant regression fails the build.
//!
//! | Entrypoint | Metric | Ceiling |
//! |------------|--------|---------|
//! | `register_contract` | CPU instructions | 5_000_000 |
//! | `get_active_contracts` | CPU instructions | 20_000_000 |
//! | `get_contracts_by_category` | CPU instructions | 20_000_000 |
//! | `get_contracts_by_tag` | CPU instructions | 20_000_000 |
//! | `get_active_contracts` | Memory bytes | 1_000_000 |
//!
//! When a ceiling is intentionally raised, update this table in the same
//! commit so the regression stays visible in review.

/// commit.
///
/// | Code | Name | Meaning | Usual remedy |
/// |------|------|---------|--------------|
/// | 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` was called on a deployment that already has an admin set. | Do not call `initialize` again; read `get_admins` / `get_threshold` to inspect the existing configuration. |
/// | 2 | `Unauthorized` | The caller is not the registered owner and not permitted to perform this action. | Call from the registered owner's address, or route the action through the governance flow (`propose_*` → `approve_proposal` → `execute_proposal`). |
/// | 3 | `AlreadyRegistered` | A `Contract` entry already exists for this `contract_id`. | Use `update_metadata` / `set_categories` to change the existing entry, or `deregister` it first if you intend to re-register. |
/// | 4 | `ContractNotFound` | No `Contract` entry exists for the given `contract_id`. | Check `is_registered` before calling; register the contract first with `register_contract`. |
/// | 5 | `InvalidMetadata` | The supplied metadata failed validation (e.g. empty batch, batch larger than 100 entries). | Pass a non-empty batch of at most 100 entries and ensure each entry has a name and description. |
/// | 6 | `NotOwner` | The caller is not the `owner` recorded on the registration. | Call from the recorded owner's address, or have the current owner call `transfer_ownership` first. |
/// | 7 | `NotInitialized` | The registry has no admin set because `initialize` was never called. | Deploy with the `__constructor` bootstrap admin, or call `initialize` once with a non-empty admin set. |
/// | 8 | `ProposalNotFound` | No proposal exists for the given `proposal_id`. | Read `get_proposal` for a valid ID; IDs are assigned sequentially starting at 0. |
/// | 9 | `ThresholdNotMet` | The proposal has not collected enough approvals, or has not yet become ready. | Have additional admins call `approve_proposal` until `approvals.len()` reaches `get_threshold`. |
/// | 10 | `TimelockNotElapsed` | Fewer than `TIMELOCK_LEDGERS` ledgers have passed since the proposal became ready. | Wait until `ready_at + TIMELOCK_LEDGERS` and retry `execute_proposal`. |
/// | 11 | `AlreadyApproved` | This admin address has already approved this proposal. | Do not re-approve; have a different admin approve instead. |
/// | 12 | `NotAdmin` | The caller is not a member of the current admin set. | Call from an address returned by `get_admins`, or propose adding the caller via `propose_add_admin`. |
/// | 13 | `InvalidThreshold` | The admin set would be empty, or the threshold is zero or exceeds the set size. | Pass a non-empty admin set with `1 <= threshold <= admins.len()`. |
/// | 14 | `AlreadyExecuted` | The proposal has already been executed. | Do not retry; create a new proposal if further action is needed. |
/// | 15 | `StakingNotConfigured` | No stake token / treasury has been set, so staking is not open. | Have governance pass `propose_configure_staking` and execute it before staking. |
/// | 16 | `InvalidAmount` | A stake, slash, or fee amount was zero or negative. | Pass a strictly positive amount for `stake` / `propose_slash`, and a non-negative fee for `propose_set_registration_fee`. |
/// | 17 | `InsufficientStake` | The registration's staked balance is smaller than the requested amount. | Stake more first with `stake`, or reduce the requested amount to at most `get_stake`. |
/// | 18 | `StakeLocked` | The stake is still inside the post-slash lock window. | Wait until `get_reputation(...).withdraw_locked_until` and retry `withdraw_stake`. |
/// | 19 | `RegistrationActive` | The registration is still active, so it cannot be withdrawn or deregistered. | Call `deactivate` first, then retry `withdraw_stake` or `deregister`. |
/// | 20 | `NoCategories` | A registration or category query declared no categories. | Pass at least one `Category` (use `Category::Other` if none of the vocabulary fits). |
/// | 21 | `StakeNotEmpty` | The registration still holds stake, so it cannot be deregistered. | Call `withdraw_stake` until `get_stake` returns zero, then retry `deregister`. |
/// | 22 | `InvalidRateLimit` | The rate limit configuration is invalid (zero window with a non-zero limit, or a window larger than `max_ttl`). | Pass `window_ledgers` in `1..=max_ttl` when `limit > 0`, or set `limit = 0` to disable limiting. |
/// | 23 | `NotAllowlisted` | The owner is not allowlisted while permissioned registration is enabled. | Have governance execute `propose_set_allowlisted(owner, true)`, or disable the allowlist with `propose_set_allowlist_enabled(false)`. |
/// | 24 | `RegistrationRateLimited` | The per-owner registration rate limit has been exceeded for the current window. | Wait for the current window to elapse, or have governance raise the limit via `propose_configure_registration_rate_limit`. |
/// | 25 | `InsufficientFee` | The registration fee was not paid. | Ensure the owner holds at least `get_registration_fee()` of the stake token and approves the transfer before registering. |
/// | 26 | `InvalidTags` | The tag count exceeds 10, or a tag is longer than 16 characters. | Pass at most 10 tags, each at most 16 characters long. |
/// | 27 | `InvalidAttestation` | Attestation label is empty, too long, or the registration already has the maximum number of attestations. | Pass a non-empty label of at most `MAX_ATTESTATION_LABEL_LEN` bytes, or revoke an existing attestation first. |
/// | 28 | `AttestationNotFound` | The caller has no attestation to revoke on this registration. | Only the attester themselves can revoke; check `get_attestations` for the caller's address. |
/// | 29 | `OverlappingAddress` | The proposed treasury or stake token is itself a registered contract. | Choose a token/treasury address that is not already registered. |
/// | 30 | `AdminSetTooSmall` | The admin set would have fewer than `MIN_ADMINS` members. | Do not remove an admin that would drop the set below the minimum. |
/// | 31 | `AlreadyAdmin` | The proposed address is already a member of the admin set. | Propose a different address, or skip `propose_add_admin` for one already an admin. |
/// | 32 | `AdminNotFound` | The proposed address to remove is not a member of the admin set. | Check `get_admins` for the current set before proposing a removal. |
/// | 33 | `ThresholdAlreadySet` | The proposed threshold is already the current threshold. | Propose a different threshold. |
/// | 34 | `AlreadyVerified` | The proposed verification status matches the contract's current status. | Check `is_verified` before proposing a change. |
/// | 35 | `StakingAlreadyConfigured` | Staking is already configured with the proposed token and treasury. | Propose a different token/treasury pair, or skip the proposal. |
/// | 36 | `InvalidInput` | Caller-supplied input failed validation (e.g. an empty slash response). | Pass a non-empty, valid value. |
/// | 37 | `SlashNotFound` | No slash exists at the given index in a registration's slash history. | Check `get_slashes` for valid indices before calling `respond_to_slash`. |
/// | 38 | `ResponseAlreadyExists` | The referenced slash already has a recorded response. | Responses are immutable once set; there is nothing further to call. |
/// | 39 | `ContractBalanceInsufficient` | The registry's real token balance is smaller than the total it believes is staked. | This signals a token/registry desync (e.g. a fee-on-transfer token); investigate before retrying. |

// ─── Storage shapes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ## Upgrade-compatibility rules
//
// A wasm upgrade (executed through `propose_upgrade` → `approve_proposal` →
// `execute_proposal`) replaces the contract's code but leaves every ledger
// entry it has already written exactly as it is.  When changing these types:
//
// - Adding a `DataKey` variant is safe; renaming or repurposing one is not
//   (encoded by variant *name*).
// - Adding, removing, renaming, or retyping a struct field breaks every
//   existing entry.  A release that must change `ContractEntry` needs a
//   migration (see `DEPLOY.md`).
// - Bump [`CONTRACT_VERSION`] alongside any such change.
//
// `registry-v2/src/lib.rs` re-declares both types independently and reads
// back storage written by this version — that test keeps these rules honest.

/// Stored entry describing a registered Soroban contract.
#[contracttype]

// ─── Category taxonomy ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ## Why a fixed enum rather than free-form `Vec<Symbol>` tags
//
// Tags are more flexible, and that is exactly the problem. The point of
// categories here is *browsing* — "show me the DeFi contracts" — and free-form
// tags fragment that immediately: `DeFi`, `defi`, `De-Fi` and `Defi` become
// four categories that each hold a slice of the answer, with no way for a
// client to know they are the same thing. A discovery surface needs a shared
// vocabulary more than it needs expressiveness.
//
// A fixed enum also keeps `DataKey::ByCategory` a bounded key space, so the
// number of index entries is a property of the contract rather than of what
// registrants happen to type.
//
// The cost is that adding a category needs a contract upgrade. That was a real
// objection before the registry became upgradeable; now it is a normal release
// (see `DEPLOY.md`), and adding a variant is safe under the storage rules above
// because `#[contracttype]` enums encode by variant *name* — existing entries
// keep decoding as long as current variants are neither renamed nor
// repurposed. [`Category::Other`] is the escape hatch in the meantime, so
// nothing is unclassifiable while waiting for that release.

/// The category vocabulary a registration can be browsed under.
///
/// Append new variants at the end and never rename or repurpose an existing
/// one — see the storage rules above.

// ─── Reputation types ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Reputation is stored *beside* `ContractEntry`, never inside it. Adding
// fields to `ContractEntry` would break every entry already written by v1 —
// see the upgrade-compatibility rules above — and would force a migration on
// the live testnet deployment for what is, from storage's point of view,
// purely additive data. New `DataKey` variants cost nothing and are safe.

// ─── Third-party attestations ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ## Why this is not `Verified`
//
// `Verified` is the governance signal: only the admin set, through a
// threshold-and-timelocked proposal, can set it, and a registrant cannot
// vouch for themselves. That is exactly the property that makes it worth
// anything, so this feature deliberately does not touch it — there is no
// `attest`-driven path to `Verified` and no counter that aggregates
// attestations into it.
//
// An attestation is a weaker, explicitly *named* claim. "Account X says this
// contract is audited" is a different and more modest statement than
// "the registry vouches for this contract", and conflating them would let
// anyone inflate the verified signal by attaching cheap labels to a
// registration. Keeping them separate means a consumer can weight them
// differently, and can show the attester's address either way.
//
// What an attestation *is* good for is the transparency property: the
// attester's address is recorded on-chain, so a claim cannot be anonymous,
// and the attester can withdraw it themselves. A wrong attestation is
// therefore contestable by the party it misleads, without needing governance
// to act.
//
// Labels are bounded in both count and length (see
// [`MAX_ATTESTATIONS_PER_CONTRACT`] and [`MAX_ATTESTATION_LABEL_LEN`]) so one
// party cannot inflate a registration's state with unbounded storage at a
// cost imposed on every future reader of that list.

    // helper approves *any* address's authorization, including one the

    // call panics with `Error(Auth, InvalidAction)`. Removing the
